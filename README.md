# Computational_Methods-Final_Project
UoC - Summer 2025

This final project provides a comprehensive computational analysis of the Greenwood, Her-
cowitz, Huffman (1988) Real Business Cycle model with endogenous capacity utilization and
investment-specific technology shocks. The project systematically implements and compares
multiple numerical solution methods while conducting empirical validation against actual
macroeconomic data.
